# Introduction to WireMock Pluralsight - Before Demos

This is a best-effort to provide all of the modules and demos in an "after" state seen at the end of each video.

**The full build will not pass**. This is because some tests are dependent on external dependencies that must
be started explicitly, or because there is additional setup such as installing TLS certificates. So, for this
to be useful, follow through the demos in the course in sequence.

If you want to see the "before" state, visit the `pre-demo` branch:
